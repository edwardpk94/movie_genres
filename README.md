# Movie Genres: predict the genre(s) of a movie given its title

This is a work-in-progress portfolio project! 

Objective: create a full-stack machine learning model, including dataset selection, preprocessing, training, and deployment

Milestones:
- ~Identify dataset and task~ **(predict movie genres given title)**
- ~Clean/preprocess data in a notebook~
- ~Train/test model(s) in a notebook~
- ~Convert preprocessing code to *.py module(s)~
- ~Create flask API~
- Dockerize API
- Deploy API (AWS/Heroku)
- Backtrack and improve the performance of the model.
  - Try CounterVectorizer instead of tf-idf
  - More robust hyperparameter optimization
